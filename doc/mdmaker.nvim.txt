WARNING                                         *mdmaker.nvim-mdmaker-warning*

- MdMaker goes through your Neovim configuration files and finds the plugins repo
    names, generates url and creates README.md file.
    Because it is using lua patterns to match the plugin names, it could (rarely)
    make a mistake (for example if you have a string `"some_non-blank_characters/same_thing"`
    in your config that is inside of a comment or something similar).
    If that happens consider enabling `enable_url_check` option. It will take some
    time to finish (1-10 sec on avg. depending on number of plugins, internet speed etc.).
    Note that while it validates urls, It **WILL NOT** block your Neovim instance! It will
    work in the background and it will notify you when your README is generated.
- This plugin was only tested on Linux systems.
- This plugin was created for my personal use (since I’m a lazy bastard).
    I shared it so someone can fork it and customize according to their personal needs if they
    don’t like my 'style' of writing READMEs (e.g. icon choice, sorting order of plugins, etc.).
