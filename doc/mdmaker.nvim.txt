WARNING                                         *mdmaker.nvim-mdmaker-warning*

MdMaker goes through your Neovim configuration files and finds the plugins repo
names, generates url and creates README.md file. This plugin was only tested on
Linux systems and it was created for my personal use. I shared it so someone
can fork it and customize according to their personal needs.
