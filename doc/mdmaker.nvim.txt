WARNING                                         *mdmaker.nvim-mdmaker-warning*

MdMaker goes through your Neovim configuration files and finds the plugins repo
names, generates url and creates README.md file. Because it is using lua
patterns to match the plugin names, it could (rarely) make a mistake (for
example if you have a string `"some_non-blank_characters/same_thing"` in your
config that is inside of a comment or something similar). If that happens
consider enabling `enable_url_check` option (I will try to make it more
efficient and viable, but for now use it only when you really need it). This
plugin was only tested on Linux systems and it was created for my personal use.
I shared it so someone can fork it and customize according to their personal
needs.
