<details>
<summary>Full list of options with their default values</summary>

```lua
{
    nvim_dir = "~/.config/nvim/",
    output = "~/.config/nvim/README.md",
    enable_url_check = false, -- disable if generating README.md offline or with bad connection
    package_maganer = "folke/lazy.nvim",
    -- if you don't want any of the following fields, set them to ""
    title = "Neovim configuration",
    version_manager = { name = "", url = "" },
    gui = { name = "", url = "" },
}

```

</details>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
* MdMaker goes through your Neovim configuration files and finds the plugins repo
names, generates url and creates README.md file.
Because it is using lua patterns to match the plugin names, it could (rarely)
make a mistake (for example if you have a string `"some_non-blank_characters/same_thing"`
in your config that is inside of a comment or something similar).
If that happens consider enabling `enable_url_check` option. It will take some
time to finish (1-10 sec on avg. depending on number of plugins, internet speed etc.).
Note that while it validates urls, It **WILL NOT** block your Neovim instance! It will
work in the background and it will notify you when your README is generated.
* This plugin was only tested on Linux systems.
* This plugin was created for my personal use (since I'm a lazy bastard).
I shared it so someone can fork it and customize according to their personal needs if they
don't like my 'style' of writing READMEs (e.g. icon choice, sorting order of plugins, etc.).
